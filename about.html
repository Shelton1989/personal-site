                    <p>Fair warning, there is quite a bit of reading ahead so please be warned.</p>
                    <h5>About this site</h5>
                    <p>This site was written in HTML 5 and uses a CSS framework called Materialize. It is a lesser known framework, most developers 
                        use the bootstrap framework but Materialize was developed by Google. The style of this site could've been written from scratch 
                        but I chose to use a framework because of the following reasons: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- They are made so that you don't have to rewrite code.</li>
                        <li>- They are always maintained by the creators and therefore easy to maintain.</li>
                        <li>- They are modern and easy to incorporate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This Site includes the JQuery library but I haven't incorporated it because all the Javascript on this site is written in pure 
                        Javascript. Mainly because it's a force of habit. The main components using JavaScript:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The home page slide.</li>
                        <li>- The contact page form</li>
                        <li>- The services page cards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The slide is pretty much basic JS. It's essentially just a counter variable adding on numbers to an image id so that the large 
                        image inherits the src attribute value of the the thumbnail. There in also an interval set so that the slide show runs on its 
                        own.</p>
                    <p>The contact page is fairly simple. It uses emailJS methods for sending mails from an API. Basically, The form is a standard 
                        HTML form. It collects all the information from the user, a JS variable stores it in a JSON object and emailJS puts it in a 
                        template and sends it to a recipient email. Easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>The cards on the service page were not written by me but rather by Materialize. I assume it works the same way that the Bootstrap 
                        collapsible menu does.
                    </p>

                    <h5>About me</h5>
                    <p>Well, I started my web development hobby in 2013 manipulating Joomla and Wordpress sites while working as a construction foreman 
                        because my formal education is in Civil Engineering. I built sites for friends and family, It was mostly with templates and site 
                        builders. In 2017 I started following Django Tutorials and couldn't really follow because it's like going on a road 
                        trip with no tyres and gas in the tank since Django is a Python framework. So, I learned the Python programming language over 
                        a two week binge learning session with Codecademy and YouTube videos. I spent another week studying the Django documentation and 
                        I started writing my first web app after that which was an ecommerce site. The site was bland an uninteresting but functional, so 
                        I decided to spice it up by learning HTML and CSS in depth. Then I learned Javascript over another two week binge learning session. 
                        Since then I formalised my skills on coursera with a certificate from the University of London as well as countless hours of coding 
                        some apps for friends and web sites for myself and other clients.
